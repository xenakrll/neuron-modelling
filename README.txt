This directory contains the software associated with Danziger & Grill J. Comp. Neuro. 2014.

- Open the file ‘Main’ using the MATLAB editor.

This file is a script separated into sections, each of which is the code needed to generate the analysis
in the paper. The supporting functions needed are included in the directory. 

Each section is commented to explain which analysis is being done. In cases with long run-time
simulations an option to use pre-generated data is available in addition to the simulation code.
This is done by changing the ‘dataFlag’ variable.
